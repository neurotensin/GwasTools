Description: whole-genome association analysis toolset
 plink expects as input the data from SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism)
 chips of many individuals and their phenotypical description of a disease.
 It finds associations of single or pairs of DNA variations with a phenotype
 and can retrieve SNP annotation from an online source.
 .
 SNPs can evaluated individually or as pairs for their association with the
 disease phenotypes. The joint investigation of copy number variations is
 supported. A variety of statistical tests have been implemented.
 .
 plink2 is a comprehensive update of plink and plink1.9 with new algorithms
 and new methods, faster and less memory consumer than the first plink.
